The user wants me to execute a simple shell command: [38;2;216;177;114mecho E2E_TEST_SUCCESS[0m. This is a straightforward task that requires using the shell tool to execute this command.

Since this is a simple single-step task, I don't need to use the TODO tools - I can just execute the command directly using the shell tool.

I'll execute the echo command for you.
