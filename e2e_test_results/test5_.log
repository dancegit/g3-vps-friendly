The user is asking me to help with deploying a project called "vibe-kanban-expert-manager" on Dokploy (which seems to be a deployment platform). They mention:

1. Using Dokploy MCP (Model Context Protocol) to configure the project
2. Setting up correct subdomains that point to the correct docker image in local Dokploy
3. Login credentials defined in .env
4. Playwright MCP web tests for user stories
5. Websocket errors after logging in

This is a complex multi-step task that involves:
• Understanding the project structure
• Setting up Dokploy deployment
• Configuring subdomains and docker images
• Fixing websocket errors in web tests
• Working with environment variables and credentials

Since this involves multiple steps and tools, I should use the TODO tools to create a plan. Let me first read the current state and understand what we're working with.

I need to:
1. First explore the project structure to understand what we're dealing with
2. Check for existing configuration files
3. Look at the Dokploy MCP setup
4. Examine the websocket errors and tests
5. Fix the issues

Let me start by reading the TODO and creating a plan, then exploring the project.

I'll help you deploy the vibe-kanban-expert-manager on Dokploy and fix the websocket errors. Let me start by exploring the project structure and creating a plan.
