The user wants me to:
1. List all files in the current directory
2. Check if README.md exists
3. If it does, show the first 10 lines
4. Provide a summary

This is a simple task that I can complete with 2-3 tool calls. I should use the shell tool to list files and potentially read the README.md if it exists. Let me start by listing the files in the current directory.

I'll help you list the files, check for README.md, and provide a summary. Let me start by listing all files in the current directory.
<tool_call>
<tool name="shell"
args="command="ls -la"/>
