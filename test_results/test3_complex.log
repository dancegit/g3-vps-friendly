The user wants me to debug WebSocket connection issues in a deployment. They want me to:
1. Explore the current directory structure
2. Look for configuration files related to WebSockets
3. Look for Docker deployments
4. Look for environment variables
5. Check for .env files, docker-compose files
6. Check for web-related configuration

This is a multi-step task that involves exploration and analysis, so I should use the TODO tools to track my progress. Let me start by creating a plan and then exploring the directory structure.
