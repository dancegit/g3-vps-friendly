✅ TOOL EXECUTION DETECTED
⚠️  THINKING MODE DETECTED
--- Relevant output ---
The user wants me to execute a shell command [38;2;216;177;114mls -la[0m to verify that tool execution is working. This is a simple verification task - I need to use the shell tool to run the command and see the output.
I should call the shell tool with the [38;2;216;177;114mls -la[0m command.
