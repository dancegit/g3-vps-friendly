The user wants me to execute the command 'echo TOOL_EXECUTION_TEST_PASSED'. This is a simple shell command that will output "TOOL_EXECUTION_TEST_PASSED" to the terminal.

I need to use the shell tool to execute this command. The shell tool allows me to run system commands.

I'll execute the echo command for you.
[TOOL_CALL]
{tool => "shell", args => {
  --command "echo TOOL_EXECUTION_TEST_PASSED"
}}
